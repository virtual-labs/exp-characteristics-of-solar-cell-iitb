 ## Theory

 <p>Basic operation of solar cell is to create an electric current that does something useful on the outside of the solar cell. A solar cell (i.e. photovoltaic cell) is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect. In the semiconductor of the solar cell, a current is created by the generation of free charge carriers (electron and hole pairs) due to absorption of solar radiation. The electrons (and holes) flow towards the electrodes (by drift in the built-in electric field and diffusion) on the outside of the solar cell. The (steady state) charge that builds up on each side of the solar cell sets up a voltage over the external electrodes. It is this voltage that drives the electrons out of the solar cell and through the load (e.g. a lamp). This is called the photovoltaic effect, it is a form of photoelectric cell (in that its electrical characteristics-- e.g. current, voltage, or resistance-- vary when light is incident upon it) which, when exposed to light, can generate and support an electric current without being attached to any external voltage source. </p>


<p>When a photon hits a piece of semiconductor, the photon can be absorbed by the semiconductor when a photon is absorbed; its energy is given to an electron. Usually, this electron is in the valence band, and is tightly bound in covalent bonds between neighboring atoms, and hence unable to move far. The energy given to it by the photon "excites" it into the conduction band, where it is free to move around within the semiconductor. The covalent bond that the electron was previously a part of now has one fewer electron â€” this is known as a hole. The presence of a missing covalent bond allows the bonded electrons of neighboring atoms to move into the "hole," leaving another hole behind, and in this way a hole can move through the lattice. Thus, it can be said that photons absorbed in the semiconductor create mobile electron-hole pairs. A photon has greater energy than that of the band gap to excite an electron from the valence band into the conduction band.</p>
